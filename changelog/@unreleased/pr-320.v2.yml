  description: |-
    Updates the way in which encrypted configuraiton values are handled
    in configuration (both install and runtime configuration). Previously,
    if configuration contained encrypted configuration values, the values
    were decrypted in the raw bytes and the result was then unmarshaled as
    YAML. This meant that it was possible for the content of the encrypted
    configuration value to influence the structure of the YAML document.

    This behavior has been modified such that, if configuration contains
    an encrypted configuration value, the configuration is interpreted as
    YAML, the encrypted configuration values are decrypted and set as the
    value on the original YAML node, and the result is then unmarshaled.
    This means that it is no longer possible for the content of an encrypted
    configuration value to modify the structure of the configuration YAML,
    with the result being that there should be better support for values such
    as multiline strings. This also makes the behavior more consistent with
    other existing implementations.

    Although using the previous behavior to modify the structure of configuration
    YAML using encrypted values was not recommended, this is a behavioral change:
    any products that depended on the previous behavior of encrypted configuration
    values modifying YAML structure on decryption will no longer work. Decrypting
    encrypted configuration values in YAML is now done by doing an unmarshal/marshal
    round-trip using yaml.v3, so this may add some extra overhead and there is a
    small possibility that it could cause behavioral issues.
