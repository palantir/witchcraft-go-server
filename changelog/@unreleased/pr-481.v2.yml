    witchcraft.ConfigurableServiceDiscovery adds WithDefaultParams and WithServiceParams methods for additional HTTP client flexibility.

    WithDefaultParams appends the provided params to all constructed clients. WithServiceParams allows for service-specific parameters.

    These enable callers to append parameters not derived from configuration (for example, based on detected runtime state).
    Generally, configuration is preferred and these additional entrypoints should be used where config can not be.
