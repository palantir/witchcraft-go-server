    Add SERVICE_DEPENDENCY health check.

    Clients created with InitInfo.Clients will now, by default, include a middleware tracking response success
    and failure by host and service name. Hosts reporting more errors than successes are surfaced in the
    SERVICE_DEPENDENCY health check. If all hosts of at least one service are failing, the check will enter
    WARNING state.

    Alerting infrastructure should ignore this check; it is used for informational and debugging
    purposes but "failures" are not the fault of the reporting service.

    This middleware can be disabled with Server.WithDisableServiceDependencyHealth()
