    Bump conjure-go to v6, which updates health status enum value constants to use the new naming convention.
    This is a breaking change for code that references the `HealthComponent` interface and the `HealthState`
    enum value constants. Consumers should update references to use the new `HealthState` enum type and
    `HealthState_Value` constants.

    In addition, this change also makes `HealthStateStatusCodes` unexported; consumers
    should switch to using the new `HealthStateStatusCode(state health.HealthState_Value) int` function instead.

    Finally, the `{Starting|Healthy|Warning|Error}State` constants have been removed. Consumers should instead
    create a new `HealthState` enum value directly.
