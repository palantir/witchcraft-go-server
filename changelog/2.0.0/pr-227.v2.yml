    The health libraries previously included in witchcraft-go-server have moved to
    witchcraft-go-health. These packages have been migrated as follow:

    ```
    witchcraft-go-server/conjure/witchcraft/api/health -> witchcraft-go-health/conjure/witchcraft/api/health
    witchcraft-go-server/status/health/* -> witchcraft-go-health/sources/*
    witchcraft-go-server/status/reporter -> witchcraft-go-health/reporter
    witchcraft-go-server/status -> witchcraft-go-health/status
    ```

    Note that the `/status` package was split up and only the APIs and
    health check sources were migrated to witchcraft-go-health. The HTTP handler
    code for reporting health remains in witchcraft-go-server.
